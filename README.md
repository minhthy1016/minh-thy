# About the Assignment 
Student Union President Selection
There are 20 students who are members of the Student Union. The Student Union Presidential Election was held last month and students voted. The President's term is 2 Years. However, the union doesn't know and has not announced the President yet. Please count the total votes for each student and find out who is the elected President.
